  "validation_result": "Assessment: Needs Modification\n\nJustification: The proposed enhancement is not specific to any AAOIFI standard or Islamic principle. It is a general statement about the need for more information. While it is technically accurate and consistent with the need for thorough analysis, it does not provide any substantive improvement to a specific standard.\n\nSuggested Refinements: The proposal needs to be more specific. It should identify a particular AAOIFI standard or Islamic principle and propose a specific enhancement. For example, if the proposal is about the standard for Murabaha transactions, it could suggest a more detailed explanation of the conditions under which such transactions are permissible. This would make the proposal more meaningful and actionable.",
