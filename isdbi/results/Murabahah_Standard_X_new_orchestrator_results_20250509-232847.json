    "review_result": "## Core principles and objectives\nThe standard covers Murabahah to the Purchase Orderer transactions as practiced by Islamic financial institutions, including the conditions, procedures, rules, and modern applications. It does not cover simple Murabahah transactions that do not involve a prior promise to purchase.\n\n## Key definitions and terminology\nMurabahah to the Purchase Orderer is a transaction where an Islamic financial institution (IFI) purchases an asset based on a promise from a customer to buy the asset from the institution on Murabahah terms (cost plus profit) after the institution has purchased it.\n\n## Main requirements and procedures\n1. The IFI must acquire ownership of the asset before selling it to the customer.\n2. The IFI must bear the risks of ownership during the period between purchasing the asset and selling it to the customer.\n3. The cost price and markup must be clearly disclosed to the customer.\n4. The customer's promise to purchase is morally binding but not legally enforceable as a sale contract.\n5. The Murabahah sale contract can only be executed after the IFI has acquired ownership of the asset.\n\n## Compliance criteria and guidelines\n1. The customer identifies the asset they wish to purchase and requests the IFI to purchase it.\n2. The IFI and customer enter into a promise agreement, where the customer promises to purchase the asset after the IFI acquires it.\n3. The IFI purchases the asset from the supplier.\n4. The IFI informs the customer that it has acquired the asset and offers to sell it on Murabahah terms.\n5. The customer accepts the offer, and a Murabahah sale contract is executed.\n6. The customer pays the agreed price, either in installments or as a lump sum.\n\n## Practical implementation considerations\n1. Appointment of the customer as agent: The IFI may appoint the customer as its agent to purchase the asset on its behalf, provided that the customer acts in a genuine agency capacity.\n2. Third-party guarantees: Independent third parties may provide guarantees to protect against negligence or misconduct.\n3. Late payment: The IFI may require the customer to donate to charity in case of late payment, but may not benefit from these amounts.\n4. Rebate for early settlement: The IFI may voluntarily give a rebate for early settlement, but this cannot be stipulated in the contract.\n5. It is not permissible to roll over a Murabahah financing by extending the payment period in exchange for an increase in the amount owed.\n6. Currency exchange (sarf) must be completed before the Murabahah transaction when purchasing assets in a different currency.\n7. Conventional insurance on Murabahah assets should be avoided in favor of Takaful (Islamic insurance) when available.",

    "full_analysis_text": "## Challenges\n1. Lack of clarity on the distinction between Murabahah to the Purchase Orderer and simple Murabahah transactions could lead to confusion and misinterpretation by practitioners.\n2. The standard's focus on Murabahah to the Purchase Orderer may limit its applicability to a broader range of Murabahah transactions, potentially excluding important practices in the industry.\n3. The requirement for the IFI to bear the risks of ownership during the asset holding period may pose challenges in risk management and could affect the institution's profitability.\n4. The distinction between morally binding and legally enforceable promises in the Murabahah sale contract may create ambiguity in legal jurisdictions with varying interpretations of contractual obligations.\n5. The restriction on stipulating rebates for early settlement only voluntarily and not contractually may limit the flexibility of financial institutions in structuring Murabahah transactions.\n\n## Improvement Areas\n1. Provide more detailed guidance on the differences between various types of Murabahah transactions to ensure practitioners have a clear understanding of the applicable rules for each.\n2. Consider expanding the standard to cover a wider scope of Murabahah transactions to address the diverse practices in the Islamic finance industry.\n3. Offer additional guidance on risk mitigation strategies for IFIs during the asset holding period to enhance risk management practices within Murabahah transactions.\n4. Clarify the legal implications of the customer's promise to purchase in different jurisdictions to ensure consistent interpretation and enforcement of Murabahah contracts.\n5. Allow for more flexibility in structuring Murabahah transactions by revisiting the restrictions on contractual stipulations for rebates on early settlements, considering industry practices and market dynamics.",

This ownership transfer should be verifiable through digital means, such as blockchain technology, where applicable.\n- **Justification:** The proposed modification encourages the use of technology to provide verifiable proof of ownership transfer, enhancing transparency and trust in the process.\n\n### cross_references\n- **Section:** Key definitions and terminology\n- **Current Concept:** Murabahah to the Purchase Orderer is a transaction where an IFI purchases an asset based on a promise from a customer to buy the asset from the institution on Murabahah terms.\n- **Proposed Modification:** Murabahah to the Purchase Orderer is a transaction where an IFI purchases an asset based on a promise from a customer to buy the asset from the institution on Murabahah terms (refer to the definition of Murabahah terms in the Glossary section).\n- **Justification:** The proposed modification provides a cross-reference to the definition of Murabahah terms, ensuring that readers have a clear understanding of the term.\n\n### implementation_guidance\n- **Section:** Main requirements and procedures\n- **Current Concept:** The customer's promise to purchase is morally binding but not legally binding.\n- **Proposed Modification:** The customer's promise to purchase is morally binding but not legally binding.
