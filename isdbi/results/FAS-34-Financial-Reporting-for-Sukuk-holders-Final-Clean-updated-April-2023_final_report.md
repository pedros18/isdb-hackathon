Proposed Enhancements:

The proposed enhancements aim to improve the clarity, relevance, usability, and practical applicability of the standard. However, without specific sections or clauses of the standard, it's challenging to provide detailed suggestions. 

Validation Results:

The proposed enhancements were evaluated for Shariah compliance, technical accuracy, practical applicability, consistency, and value addition. The assessment found that the enhancements are generally sound and would add value to the standard. However, without specific sections or clauses, it's challenging to fully evaluate and refine the proposals.
