    "review_result": "## Core principles and objectives\nThe standard covers Murabahah to the Purchase Orderer transactions as practiced by Islamic financial institutions. It outlines the conditions, procedures, rules, and modern applications of these transactions. The core principle is to ensure that these transactions are conducted in accordance with Shariah law, which includes the requirement for the Islamic financial institution to acquire ownership of the asset before selling it to the customer and bearing the risks of ownership during the period between purchasing the asset and selling it to the customer.\n\n## Key definitions and terminology\n- **Murabahah to the Purchase Orderer**: A transaction where an Islamic financial institution (IFI) purchases an asset based on a promise from a customer to buy the asset from the institution on Murabahah terms (cost plus profit) after the institution has purchased it.\n- **Promise Agreement**: An agreement where the customer promises to purchase the asset after the IFI acquires it.\n- **Murabahah Sale Contract**: The contract executed after the IFI has acquired the asset and the customer accepts the offer to buy it on Murabahah terms.\n\n## Main requirements and procedures\n1. The customer identifies the asset they wish to purchase and requests the IFI to purchase it.\n2. The IFI and customer enter into a promise agreement.\n3. The IFI purchases the asset from the supplier.\n4. The IFI informs the customer that it has acquired the asset and offers to sell it on Murabahah terms.\n5. The customer accepts the offer, and a Murabahah sale contract is executed.\n6. The customer pays the agreed price, either in installments or as a lump sum.\n\n## Compliance criteria and guidelines\n1. The IFI must acquire ownership of the asset before selling it to the customer.\n2. The IFI must bear the risks of ownership during the period between purchasing the asset and selling it to the customer.\n3. The cost price and markup must be clearly disclosed to the customer.\n4. The customer's promise to purchase is morally binding but not legally enforceable as a sale contract.\n5. The Murabahah sale contract can only be executed after the IFI has acquired ownership of the asset.\n\n## Practical implementation considerations\n1. The IFI may appoint the customer as its agent to purchase the asset on its behalf, provided that the customer acts in a genuine agency capacity.\n2. Independent third parties may provide guarantees to protect against negligence or misconduct.\n3. The IFI may require the customer to donate to charity in case of late payment, but may not benefit from these amounts.\n4. The IFI may voluntarily give a rebate for early settlement, but this cannot be stipulated in the contract.\n5. It is not permissible to roll over a Murabahah financing by extending the payment period in exchange for an increase in the amount owed.\n6. Currency exchange (sarf) must be completed before the Murabahah transaction when purchasing assets in a different currency.\n7. Conventional insurance on Murabahah assets should be avoided in favor of Takaful (Islamic insurance) when available.",

    "full_analysis_text": "## Challenges\n1. **Complexity**: The standard may be too complex for practitioners to easily understand and implement, leading to potential misinterpretations or non-compliance.\n2. **Enforcement**: Ensuring compliance with the requirement for the IFI to acquire ownership of the asset before selling it to the customer and bearing the risks of ownership can be challenging to monitor effectively.\n3. **Legal Clarity**: The distinction between morally binding promises and legally enforceable contracts may create ambiguity and potential legal challenges in case of disputes.\n4. **Charity Donations**: The requirement for customers to donate to charity in case of late payment may raise practical challenges in terms of enforcement and transparency.\n5. **Rebate Restrictions**: The restriction on stipulating rebates for early settlement in the contract may limit flexibility for IFIs and customers in managing their financial arrangements.\n\n## Improvement Areas\n1. **Simplification**: The standard could benefit from simplification of language and processes to enhance clarity and ease of implementation for practitioners.\n2. **Monitoring Mechanisms**: Implementing robust monitoring mechanisms to ensure IFIs comply with ownership acquisition and risk-bearing requirements could strengthen enforcement and adherence to Shariah principles.\n3. **Legal Framework**: Clarifying the legal implications of promises and contracts within the standard to avoid potential legal disputes and provide clear guidance for practitioners.\n4. **Charity Mechanisms**: Developing clearer guidelines on how charity donations in case of late payment should be managed to ensure transparency and consistency in implementation.\n5. **Flexibility in Rebates**: Considering allowing flexibility for IFIs and customers to agree on rebates for early settlement within certain parameters to accommodate varying financial needs and circumstances.",
