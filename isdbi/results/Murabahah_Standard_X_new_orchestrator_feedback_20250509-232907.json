  "feedback_analysis": "## Stakeholder Categories\n1. Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs)\n2. Shariah Scholars\n3. Regulators\n\n## Feedback Patterns and Themes\n1. **Technological Integration:** IFIs expressed concerns about the complexity of implementing blockchain technology for Murabahah tracking.\n2. **Documentation Guidelines:** Both IFIs and regulators highlighted the need for more specific guidelines on documentation, particularly for agency arrangements and standardized documentation.\n3. **Shariah Compliance:** Shariah scholars requested further elaboration on risk transfer mechanisms to ensure full Shariah compliance.\n\n## Feedback Validity Analysis\n1. **Technological Integration:** The feedback from IFIs is valid as implementing blockchain technology can be complex and resource-intensive. It may not be feasible for all IFIs, particularly smaller ones.\n2. **Documentation Guidelines:** The feedback from IFIs and regulators is valid. Clear and specific guidelines for documentation can help ensure transparency, facilitate regulatory oversight, and reduce disputes.\n3. **Shariah Compliance:** The feedback from Shariah scholars is critical to ensure that the proposed modifications are in line with Shariah principles.\n\n## Recommended Refinements\n1. **Technological Integration:** Modify the proposal to suggest that IFIs should explore and gradually adopt digital means for verifying ownership transfer, rather than mandating the use of blockchain technology.\n2. **Documentation Guidelines:** Provide more specific guidelines on documentation for agency arrangements and standardized documentation. This could include examples of best practices or a checklist of required elements.\n3. **Shariah Compliance:** Collaborate with Shariah scholars to further elaborate on risk transfer mechanisms in a way that ensures full Shariah compliance. This could involve providing more detailed explanations or examples.\n\n## Feedback Incorporation Process Suggestions\n1. **Technological Integration:** Conduct a feasibility study or pilot project on the use of blockchain technology in Murabahah transactions. Use the findings to refine the proposal and provide practical guidance for IFIs.\n2. **Documentation Guidelines:** Form a working group consisting of representatives from IFIs and regulators to develop specific guidelines on documentation. Solicit feedback on draft guidelines from a wider group of stakeholders before finalizing.\n3. **Shariah Compliance:** Organize a workshop or consultation session with Shariah scholars to discuss the proposed modifications on risk transfer mechanisms. Incorporate their feedback into the final proposal.",
