    "review_result": "## Core principles and objectives\nThe standard covers Murabahah to the Purchase Orderer transactions as practiced by Islamic financial institutions. It outlines the conditions, procedures, rules, and modern applications of these transactions. The core objective is to ensure that these transactions are conducted in accordance with Shariah principles, which include the requirement for the financial institution to bear the risks of ownership and disclose the cost price and markup to the customer.\n\n## Key definitions and terminology\n- **Murabahah to the Purchase Orderer**: A transaction where an Islamic financial institution (IFI) purchases an asset based on a promise from a customer to buy the asset from the institution on Murabahah terms (cost plus profit) after the institution has purchased it.\n- **Promise Agreement**: An agreement where the customer promises to purchase the asset after the IFI acquires it.\n- **Murabahah Sale Contract**: A contract documenting the actual sale transaction.\n- **Takaful**: Islamic insurance.\n\n## Main requirements and procedures\n1. The customer identifies the asset they wish to purchase and requests the IFI to purchase it.\n2. The IFI and customer enter into a promise agreement.\n3. The IFI purchases the asset from the supplier.\n4. The IFI informs the customer that it has acquired the asset and offers to sell it on Murabahah terms.\n5. The customer accepts the offer, and a Murabahah sale contract is executed.\n6. The customer pays the agreed price, either in installments or as a lump sum.\n\n## Compliance criteria and guidelines\n1. The IFI must acquire ownership of the asset before selling it to the customer.\n2. The IFI must bear the risks of ownership during the period between purchasing the asset and selling it to the customer.\n3. The cost price and markup must be clearly disclosed to the customer.\n4. The customer's promise to purchase is morally binding but not legally enforceable as a sale contract.\n5. The Murabahah sale contract can only be executed after the IFI has acquired ownership of the asset.\n\n## Practical implementation considerations\n1. The IFI may appoint the customer as its agent to purchase the asset on its behalf, provided that the customer acts in a genuine agency capacity.\n2. Independent third parties may provide guarantees to protect against negligence or misconduct.\n3. The IFI may require the customer to donate to charity in case of late payment, but may not benefit from these amounts.\n4. The IFI may voluntarily give a rebate for early settlement, but this cannot be stipulated in the contract.\n5. It is not permissible to roll over a Murabahah financing by extending the payment period in exchange for an increase in the amount owed.\n6. Currency exchange (sarf) must be completed before the Murabahah transaction when purchasing assets in a different currency.\n7. Conventional insurance on Murabahah assets should be avoided in favor of Takaful (Islamic insurance) when available.",

    "full_analysis_text": "## Challenges\n1. **Complexity**: The standard may be too complex for practitioners to easily understand and implement, especially for those new to Islamic finance.\n2. **Lack of Clarity**: Some requirements and procedures may lack clarity, leading to potential misinterpretations and non-compliance.\n3. **Enforcement**: Ensuring compliance with the standard across different Islamic financial institutions may be challenging without a robust enforcement mechanism.\n4. **Practicality**: Some practical implementation considerations, such as appointing the customer as an agent or requiring donations for late payments, may not always be feasible or practical in real-world scenarios.\n5. **Currency Exchange Risk**: The requirement to complete currency exchange before the Murabahah transaction may expose institutions to currency exchange risks, especially in volatile markets.\n\n## Improvement Areas\n1. **Simplification**: Simplify the language and structure of the standard to make it more accessible and easier to implement for a wider range of practitioners.\n2. **Clarification**: Provide more detailed examples and explanations to clarify complex requirements and procedures, reducing the risk of misinterpretation.\n3. **Training and Guidance**: Offer training and guidance sessions to help institutions understand and implement the standard effectively.\n4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Establish a monitoring and reporting framework to track compliance with the standard and address any non-compliance issues promptly.\n5. **Flexibility**: Introduce flexibility in certain practical implementation considerations to accommodate varying business models and operational constraints of different institutions.\n6. **Risk Management**: Provide guidance on managing currency exchange risks effectively within the Murabahah transactions to protect institutions from potential losses.",

    "enhancement_proposals": "### Clarity Improvements\n\n**Section:** Core principles and objectives\n\n**Current Concept:** The standard outlines the conditions, procedures, rules, and modern applications of Murabahah transactions.\n\n**Proposed Modification:** The standard should provide a more detailed explanation of the core principles and objectives of Murabahah transactions, including the rationale behind each requirement and procedure.\n\n**Justification:** This will help users better understand the purpose and importance of each requirement and procedure, and how they contribute to the overall objective of ensuring Shariah compliance.\n\n### Modern Adaptations\n\n**Section:** Main requirements and procedures\n\n**Current Concept:** The standard outlines the traditional process of Murabahah transactions.\n\n**Proposed Modification:** The standard should be updated to reflect modern practices and technologies, such as digital platforms for identifying and purchasing assets, and electronic contracts.\n\n**Justification:** This will ensure that the standard remains relevant and applicable in the modern business environment, and can guide Islamic financial institutions in implementing Murabahah transactions using modern technologies.\n\n### Tech Integration\n\n**Section:** Practical implementation considerations\n\n**Current Concept:** The standard provides general guidelines for implementing Murabahah transactions.\n\n**Proposed Modification:** The standard should include specific guidance on integrating technology into the implementation of Murabahah transactions, such as using blockchain for contract execution and payment tracking, and AI for risk assessment and pricing.\n\n**Justification:** This will help Islamic financial institutions leverage technology to improve the efficiency, transparency, and accuracy of Murabahah transactions.\n\n### Cross References\n\n**Section:** Compliance criteria and guidelines\n\n**Current Concept:** The standard provides standalone compliance criteria and guidelines.\n\n**Proposed Modification:** The standard should cross-reference relevant sections in other AAOIFI standards, such as the standards on promise agreements, risk management, and Takaful.\n\n**Justification:** This will help users understand the interconnections between different aspects of Islamic finance, and ensure a holistic approach to compliance.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Section:** Practical implementation considerations\n\n**Current Concept:** The standard provides general considerations for practical implementation.\n\n**Proposed Modification:** The standard should provide more detailed guidance on practical implementation, including case studies, best practices, and common pitfalls to avoid.\n\n**Justification:** This will help Islamic financial institutions implement Murabahah transactions more effectively and avoid common mistakes.",
