  "validation_result": "Assessment: Needs Modification\n\nJustification:\n\n1. Shariah Compliance: The proposed enhancements do not violate any known Shariah principles. However, the proposal to include modern financial instruments such as cryptocurrencies and digital assets needs careful consideration as the Shariah compliance of these instruments is still a matter of debate among scholars.\n\n2. Technical Accuracy: The proposed enhancements are technically sound. However, the proposal to include digital technologies for reporting and disclosure needs to be more specific. For instance, what kind of blockchain technology is being referred to? Public or private? Permissioned or permissionless?\n\n3. Practical Applicability: The proposed enhancements are generally practical. However, the proposal to include modern financial instruments such as cryptocurrencies and digital assets may not be practically applicable in many jurisdictions due to regulatory constraints.\n\n4. Consistency: The proposed enhancements are consistent with other standards and established practices. However, the proposal to include modern financial instruments such as cryptocurrencies and digital assets needs to be aligned with other relevant AAOIFI standards.\n\n5. Value Addition: The proposed enhancements add value to the standard by improving clarity, relevance, and comprehensiveness.\n\nSuggested Refinements:\n\n1. Clarity improvements: Approved as proposed.\n2. Modern context adaptations: Modify the proposal to include a section that addresses the use of modern financial instruments, subject to Shariah and regulatory compliance.\n3. Technological integration: Modify the proposal to specify the type of blockchain technology to be used for reporting and disclosure.\n4. Cross-reference enhancements: Approved as proposed.\n5. Practical implementation: Approved as proposed.",
